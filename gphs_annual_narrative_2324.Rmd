## 1. Things you should know

### 1.1 Introduction {.toc-ignore} 



This publication is an accredited official statistic release. Accredited official statistics status means that General Pharmaceutical Services (GPhS) - England complies with the [Code of Practice for Statistics](https://code.statisticsauthority.gov.uk/), showing trustworthiness, quality and value. 
    
The designation of this publication as an accredited official statistic was confirmed in December 2021 following an independent review by the Office for Statistics Regulation (OSR). You can read more about this confirmation and the assessment of these statistics on the [OSR website.](https://osr.statisticsauthority.gov.uk/correspondence/ed-humpherson-to-matthew-wilson-confirmation-of-national-statistics-designation-for-statistics-on-general-pharmaceutical-services-in-england/)

### 1.2 Background {.toc-ignore} 


From 1 April 2013, NHS England has been responsible for the commissioning of NHS pharmaceutical services in England and for negotiating changes to arrangements for the provision of services. The [Community Pharmacy Contractual Framework](https://cpe.org.uk/quality-and-regulations/the-pharmacy-contract/) (CPCF) for pharmacy contractors is set out in [The National Health Service (Pharmaceutical and Local Pharmaceutical Services) Regulations 2013](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2013/349/contents/made), and the Pharmaceutical Services (Advanced and Enhanced Services) (England) Directions 2013 are contained within the [Drug Tariff for England and Wales](https://www.nhsbsa.nhs.uk/pharmacies-gp-practices-and-appliance-contractors/drug-tariff).

The 2013 regulations state that a person who is not a doctor or dentist must be included in a pharmaceutical list in order to be permitted to provide pharmaceutical services for the NHS. NHS England are required to prepare and maintain lists of those whose applications have been granted to be listed as a pharmaceutical provider for both community pharmacy and appliance contractors. The lists specify both the premises and the named contractor.

To receive payment for the costs and fees incurred while providing services to the general public on behalf of the NHS, community pharmacies and appliance contractors must submit their prescriptions to NHSBSA along with a submission document, known as the FP34C. This has recently been digitised by the Manage Your Submission (MYS) application but was historically done via a paper form that accompanied paper prescription batches.

Data on advanced services such as the provision of New Medicines Service (NMS) and Appliance Use Reviews (AURs) is taken from the FP34C submission document, or from the MYS application, and passed to NHSBSA payment systems.  There it is used to calculate payments that are to be made to community pharmacies and appliance contractors

### 1.3 Scope {.toc-ignore} 

Data is collected from prescriptions submitted to the NHSBSA by dispensing contractors (community pharmacies and appliance contractors). These prescriptions are issued by GPs or other authorised prescribers such as nurses, dentists, and allied health professionals. Prescriptions that are issued by hospitals may also be dispensed in the community and submitted for reimbursement. Prescriptions that are issued in hospitals and fulfilled by the hospital pharmacy or dispensary are not included in this data.

Data is limited in this publication to only prescription items that have been dispensed by a community pharmacy or appliance contractor in England. Items dispensed by dispensing doctors, hospitals or prisons or submitted for reimbursement via a personal administration account have been excluded.

Data on advanced services provided by community pharmacies and appliance contractors is limited to where a claim has been submitted to NHSBSA in relation to performing one of those services. Counts of the number of services provided are based upon the number of times a fee has been paid to a contractor. Figures for the number of services provided are counts of the number of times a fee has been paid to a contractor for that service.


This publication aims to describe the activity of community pharmacies and appliance contractors in England across the whole financial year.

These statistics detail:

* the number of prescription items dispensed
* the reimbursement costs of prescription items dispensed
* the number of single activity fees  received
* the remuneration costs of single activity fees received
* the number of essential and advanced services provided
* the associated costs for essential and advanced services

These statistics cover the financial years between April 2015 and March 2024.

In 2023/24, there were 12,009 active community pharmacies, 595 more than in 2022/23 and the highest since 2015/16. 

The number of active appliance contractors in 2023/24 in England was 112, an increase by one compared to 2022/23.

An active community pharmacy or appliance contractor is one that has submitted prescriptions to the NHSBSA for processing in the specified time period. If a pharmacy has opened, submitted a prescription to the NHSBSA and then closed again in the same year, it would still be classed as an active pharmacy.

When a pharmacy contract changes providers it can remain in the same premises but may be given a new organisation code. This measure uses the pharmacy organisation code to determine active pharmacies. In 2023/24 an increased number of pharmacy contracts changed providers compared to previous years. This may inflate the number of active pharmacies in the year compared to the number of pharmacy premises.

The average number of items dispensed per community pharmacy has decreased by 1.97% from 94,500 in 2022/23 to 92,700 in 2023/24.  This is an increase of 11.3% from the average of 83,300 in 2015/16.

The average yearly items dispensed for appliance contractors has increased each year since 2015/16 and was higher than the average items dispensed for community pharmacies since 2020/21. The average is 104,000 in 2023/24, a 52.8% increase from 2015/16.

Costs reimbursed to contractors increased in 2023/24, for the fifth consecutive year. Costs increased by 4.97% between 2022/23 and 2023/24 from Â£9.72 billion to Â£10.2 billion, the highest costs in 9 years.

The value of SAFs received by contractors increased in 2023/24 by 3.04% to Â£1.44 billion from Â£1.40 billion in 2022/23. 

It should be noted, prior to December 2016 the figures reported are for professional fees only, and do not include the three additional payments that the SAF consists of.

## 3. About these statistics

The General Pharmaceutical Services publication (GPhS) is an official accredited statistic release. Official accredited statistic status means this release complies with the [Code of Practice for Statistics](https://code.statisticsauthority.gov.uk/), showing trustworthiness, quality, and value. 

These official statistics were independently reviewed by the (OSR) in December 2021. You can read more about this confirmation and the assessment of these statistics [on the OSR website](https://osr.statisticsauthority.gov.uk/correspondence/ed-humpherson-to-matthew-wilson-confirmation-of-national-statistics-designation-for-statistics-on-general-pharmaceutical-services-in-england/).


### 3.1. Changes made to this publication {.toc-ignore}

#### Changes to the statistical narrative 

The advanced services Smoking Cessation Service (SCS) and Pharmacy Contraceptive Service (PCS) have been added to the narrative.

#### Additions to the summary tables

Data regarding the advanced services Pharmacy Contraceptive Service (PCS) and Pharmacy First Service (PFS) have been added to the summary tables.


### 3.2. Accuracy of these statistics {.toc-ignore}

Further information on the accuracy of the data used in this publication is available in the [Background Information and Methodology supporting document](`r config$background_link`). Details regarding the impact of post payment verification (PPV) and other checks carried out by NHS Prescription Services (a division of NHSBSA) on the statistics are available in the [Impacts of errors identified on the accuracy of the General Pharmaceutical Services](https://nhsbsa-opendata.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/gphs/gps-2021-accuracy-v001.html) supporting document that accompanied the 2020/21 publication.


### 3.3. Uses of these statistics {.toc-ignore}

These statistics can be used to understand the activity of community pharmacies and appliance contractors in England, including essential and advanced services provided to NHS patients. They cannot be used to provide the total number or cost of prescription items dispensed in England in the community as they do not contain dispensing from all sources. This can be obtained from another NHSBSA official accredited statistic publication, [Prescription Cost Analysis](https://www.nhsbsa.nhs.uk/statistical-collections/prescription-cost-analysis-england).


### 3.4. Geographies included in this publication {.toc-ignore}

The geographies used in this publication are based upon NHSBSA administrative records, not geographical health boundaries as defined by the Office for National Statistics (ONS). These administrative records more closely reflect the operational organisation of dispensing contractors than other geographical data sources such as the National Statistics Postcode Lookup (NSPL).

### 3.5 Active pharmacies {.toc-ignore}

An active community pharmacy or appliance contractor is one that has submitted prescriptions to the NHSBSA for processing in the specified time period. If a pharmacy has opened, submitted a prescription to the NHSBSA and then closed again in the same year, it would still be classed as an active pharmacy.

When a pharmacy contract changes providers it can remain in the same premises but may be given a new organisation code. This measure uses the pharmacy organisation code to determine active pharmacies.

Monthly data relating to Dispensing Contractors can be accessed via the [NHSBSA Open Data Portal.](https://opendata.nhsbsa.net/theme/dispensing-contractors)


### 3.6 Planned changes to this publication {.toc-ignore}


NHSBSA plans to expand the scope of this publication in future releases to report on all fees that a contractor can claim for providing NHS services, in order to provide a more complete picture of the total cost of community pharmacy to the public purse. Next year's release will include the below:

The Pharmacy First Service (PFS) is a new advanced service which commenced in January 2024. It will replace the CPCS. The full service will consist of three elements:

* Pharmacy First (clinical pathways), a new element

* Pharmacy First (urgent repeat medicine supply), previously commissioned as the CPCS

* Pharmacy First (NHS referrals for minor illness), previously commissioned as the CPCS

It will be included in this release from the 2024/2025 publication.

The NHS Pharmacy First - Clinical Pathway consultation advanced service was introduced from 31 January 2024. Figures for items issued by through the Clinical Pathway service have been included in the overall counts for dispensed items and drug costs for pharmacies in this publication.  Further work to exclude these items will be undertaken for future iterations of this publication.

## 4. Rounding

The high-level figures in this statistical summary have been rounded where appropriate for clarity, in most cases to three significant figures. This is to make this narrative as accessible as possible to all readers. The summary tables released with this publication allow users to investigate this data at lower levels of granularity.
