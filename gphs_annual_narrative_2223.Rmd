## 1. Things you should know

### 1.1 Introduction {.toc-ignore} 



This publication is an accredited official statistic release. Accredited official statistics status means that General Pharmaceutical Services (GPhS) - England complies with the [Code of Practice for Statistics](https://code.statisticsauthority.gov.uk/), showing trustworthiness, quality and value. 
    
The designation of this publication as an accredited official statistic was confirmed in December 2021 following an independent review by the Office for Statistics Regulation (OSR). You can read more about this confirmation and the assessment of these statistics on the [OSR website.](https://osr.statisticsauthority.gov.uk/correspondence/ed-humpherson-to-matthew-wilson-confirmation-of-national-statistics-designation-for-statistics-on-general-pharmaceutical-services-in-england/)

### 1.2 Background {.toc-ignore} 


From 1 April 2013, NHS England became responsible for the commissioning of NHS pharmaceutical services in England and for negotiating changes to arrangements for the provision of services. The [Community Pharmacy Contractual Framework](https://cpe.org.uk/quality-and-regulations/the-pharmacy-contract/) (CPCF) for pharmacy contractors is set out in the [The National Health Service (Pharmaceutical and Local Pharmaceutical Services) Regulations 2013](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2013/349/contents/made), and the Pharmaceutical Services (Advanced and Enhanced Services) (England) Directions 2013 are contained within the [Drug Tariff for England and Wales](https://www.nhsbsa.nhs.uk/pharmacies-gp-practices-and-appliance-contractors/drug-tariff).

In order to be able to provide pharmaceutical services for the NHS, the 2013 regulations state that a person (other than doctors or dentists) must be included in a pharmaceutical list. NHS England are required to prepare and maintain lists of those who have been granted applications. The list specifies both the premises and the named contractor.

To receive payment for the costs and fees incurred while providing services to the general public on behalf of the NHS, community pharmacies and appliance contractors must submit their prescriptions to NHSBSA along with a submission document, known as the FP34C. This has recently been digitised by the Manage Your Submission (MYS) application but was historically done via a paper form that accompanied paper prescription batches.

Data regarding Advanced Services such as the provision of New Medicines Service (NMS) and Appliance Use Reviews (AURs) is taken from the FP34C submission document, or from the MYS application. This is then passed to NHSBSA payment systems to calculate account level payments that are to be made to community pharmacies and appliance contractors.

### 1.3 Scope {.toc-ignore} 

Data is collected from prescriptions submitted to the NHSBSA by dispensing contractors (community pharmacies and appliance contractors). These prescriptions can be issued by GPs and other authorised prescribers such as nurses, dentists, and allied health professionals. Prescriptions that are issued by hospitals can also be dispensed in the community and submitted for reimbursement. Prescriptions that are issued in hospitals and fulfilled by the hospital pharmacy or dispensary are not included in this data.

Data is limited in this publication to only prescription items that have been dispensed by a community pharmacy or appliance contractor in England. Items dispensed by dispensing doctors, hospitals or prisons or submitted for reimbursement via a personal administration account have been excluded.

Data on advanced services provided by community pharmacies and appliance contractors is limited to where a claim has been submitted to NHSBSA in relation to performing one of those services. Counts around the number of services provided are based upon the number of times a fee has been paid to a contractor. The figures around the number of contractors that provide a service are based upon the number of contractors that have received payment of at least one fee for that service.


This publication aims to describe the activity of community pharmacies and appliance contractors in England across the whole financial year.

These statistics detail:

* the number of prescription items dispensed
* the reimbursement costs of prescription items dispensed
* the number of single activity fees they have received
* the remuneration costs of single activity fees received
* the number of essential and advanced services that they have provided
* the associated costs for essential and advanced services

These statistics cover the financial years between April 2015 and March 2023.

This is not the total amount paid to contractors for dispensing an item as many fees are not included in these figures, such as additional fees that apply to controlled drugs. 

Costs reimbursed to contractors increased in 2022/23, for the fourth consecutive year. Costs increased by 7.50% between 2021/22 and 2022/23 from Â£9.05 billion to Â£9.72 billion. This is an 8 year high.

The value of SAFs  received by contractors increased in 2022/23 by 2.36% to Â£1.40 billion from Â£1.37 billion in 2021/22. This was despite a decrease in the SAF from 129 pence to 127 pence in April 2022. 

It should be noted, prior to December 2016 the figures reported are for professional fees only, and do not include the three additional payments that the SAF consists of.

## 3. About these statistics

The General Pharmaceutical Services publication (GPhS) is an official accredited statistic release. Official accredited statistic status means this release complies with the [Code of Practice for Statistics](https://code.statisticsauthority.gov.uk/), showing trustworthiness, quality, and value. 

These official statistics were independently reviewed by the Office for Statistics Regulation (OSR) in [December 2021](https://osr.statisticsauthority.gov.uk/correspondence/ed-humpherson-to-matthew-wilson-confirmation-of-national-statistics-designation-for-statistics-on-general-pharmaceutical-services-in-england/).


### 3.1. Changes made to this publication {.toc-ignore}

#### Changes to the statistical narrative 

Details of the  Community Pharmacy Consultation Services GP referral engagement fees have been removed. This was a setup payment that had to be claimed by 30th June 2021. Historical data is included in the summary tables. 

Some data regarding COVID-19 related services that were undertaken by pharmacies has been removed from this narrative, because the services are no longer operational and payments are no longer made to contractors.

This includes data and payments on:

* COVID-19 testing
* Home Delivery payments introduced during COVID-19

Historical data is included in the summary tables. 

#### Additions to the summary tables

Data regarding the advanced service Smoking Cessation Service (SCS) have been added to the summary tables.


### 3.2. Accuracy of these statistics {.toc-ignore}

Further information on the accuracy of the data used in this publication is available in the [Background Information and Methodology supporting document](`r config$background_link`). Details regarding the impact of post payment verification (PPV) and other checks carried out by NHS Prescription Services (a division of NHSBSA) on the statistics are available in the [Impacts of errors identified on the accuracy of the General Pharmaceutical Services](https://nhsbsa-opendata.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/gphs/gps-2021-accuracy-v001.html) supporting document that accompanied the 2020/21 publication.

### 3.3. PHS1 Pharmacy Data Collection  {.toc-ignore}

Data that has previously been obtained from the NHS Digital PHS1 Pharmacy Data collection is no longer available, as the collection exercise no longer takes place. An alternative data source for this data has not been identified which means this information has not been included in this report. However, some information previously included on the PHS1, such as pharmacy openings and closures and some exempt categories has been sourced from the NHSBSA administrative records.


Historic versions of this publication released by NHS Digital are [available on the NHS Digital website](https://digital.nhs.uk/data-and-information/publications/statistical/general-pharmaceutical-services). Users should always use the statistics in the latest release of the publication to make sure they are the most up to date figures available.

### 3.4. Uses of these statistics {.toc-ignore}

These statistics can be used to understand the activity of community pharmacies and appliance contractors in England, including essential and advanced services provided to NHS patients. They cannot be used to provide the total number or cost of prescription items dispensed in England in the community as they do not contain dispensing from all sources. This can be obtained from another NHSBSA official accredited statistic publication, [Prescription Cost Analysis](https://www.nhsbsa.nhs.uk/statistical-collections/prescription-cost-analysis-england).


### 3.5. Geographies included in this publication {.toc-ignore}

The geographies used in this publication are based upon NHSBSA administrative records, not geographical health boundaries as defined by the Office for National Statistics (ONS). These administrative records more closely reflect the operational organisation of dispensing contractors than other geographical data sources such as the National Statistics Postcode Lookup (NSPL).


### 3.6 Planned changes to this publication {.toc-ignore}


<!-- The NHSBSA is currently developing an open data set public feed based on the monthly [Management Information Spreadsheet](https://www.nhsbsa.nhs.uk/access-our-data-products/information-services-portal-isp/isp-report-information) (MIS) report. This is intended for release by April 2023 and will compliment this National Statistic publication.  This new data set will not be an Official Statistic release. -->

<!-- Following the release of this publication the NHSBSA will be launching a public consultation on the statistical methodology that is used in these statistics and will be seeking feedback from users and stakeholders. NHSBSA also plan to hold a user engagement event for this release in early 2021. Details of the event will be announced on the [Statistics section](https://www.nhsbsa.nhs.uk/announcements) of the NHSBSA website. -->

NHSBSA plans to expand the scope of this publication in future releases to report on all fees that a contractor can claim for providing NHS services, in order to provide a more complete picture of the total cost of community pharmacy to the public purse. Next year's release will include the advanced service of Pharmacy Contraception Service which commenced in April 2023.
